Created a web app for train ticket booking, enabling users to search for trains by date, check seat availability for the next 6 days across all classes, and view seat confirmation predictions.<br>

=> Integrated ConfirmTkt API to fetch live data.<br>
=> Implemented API caching using Redux to minimize redundant API calls and enhance performance.<br>
=> Integrated seamless page transitions through efficient routing.<br>
=> Developed multiple custom hooks to efficiently manage API calls.<br>
=> Utilized Cloudflare Workers to create a proxy for resolving CORS issues.<br>

Note:- It's a desktop app. So, please open it in a laptop or in desktop view in mobile for better experience.<br>
